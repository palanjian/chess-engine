* Cant move if it'll put the king in check
* Create check system
* En passant
* Pawn-to-queen promotion
* Get all moves should not evaluate all possible moves on the board to see if the piece can move there, instead it should evaluate it according to its ability (ex evaluate diagonals for bishops, etc )
* Castling
